# asciigame

NO FANCY COLORFUL GRAPHICS!
NO USELESS ANIMATIONS THAT MAKES YOU HEADACHE!
NO EXPENSIVE DLCS!
NO "YOU NEED TO BUY A NEW COMPUTER TO PLAY THIS GAME, DUDE!" ANYMORE!
NO "WE WON'T REALLY FINISH THE GAME, BECAUSE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER PART NEXT YEAR AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT" SHIT!
JUST PURE GAME EXPERIENCE WITH NO DISTRACTING ELEMENTS!
WHY? BECAUSE IT'S REAL!
WHY SO MANY EXCLAMATION MARKS AND CAPITALS? BECAUSE WE CAN! (and almost nobody will ever read this, so it doesn't matter)

Let's revive an old, better ways of gaming. 
Old ways are always better than anything new. (Except smart bulb, it's really cool!)

There is a long-term plan to make an ASCII game that everyone on this planet deserves to play,
but evil world leaders keep it from being done.

My target is to show the world, that ASCII is the way the games should look like!

One time ASCII, always ASCII... or probably anything else.
